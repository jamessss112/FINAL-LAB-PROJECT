## Lab 1: Titanic Dataset - Basic Analysis
**File:** `lab1_titanic_carza.ipynb`  
This notebook introduces basic data analysis using the Titanic dataset. It includes:

- Loading and exploring the dataset using `pandas`
- Computing descriptive statistics
- Filtering and slicing data
- Analyzing survival based on features like `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Age`

**Learning Objectives:**

- Gain familiarity with reading and manipulating CSV data using `pandas`
- Practice data exploration techniques and basic summary insights

## Lab 2: Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Visualization
**File:** `lab2_titanic_Carza.ipynb`  
A continuation of Lab 1, this notebook enhances the Titanic dataset analysis by introducing data cleaning and visualization:

- Handling missing values in columns like `Age` and `Cabin`
- Creating bar plots, histograms, and pie charts using `matplotlib`
- Using `groupby()` to summarize survival rates by demographic

**Learning Objectives:**

- Clean real-world data and prepare it for analysis
- Visualize key findings using basic plotting techniques
- Understand the relationship between variables and survival rate

## Lab 3: Symbolic Computation using SymPy
**File:** `lab3_sympy_Carza.ipynb`  
This notebook demonstrates the use of the `SymPy` library for symbolic mathematics in Python:

- Defining symbolic variables and expressions
- Performing calculus operations such as limits, derivatives, and integrals
- Solving algebraic equations symbolically

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand the basics of symbolic computation
- Use Python to perform algebra and calculus tasks analytically
- Learn how symbolic math tools can be integrated into scientific workflows
